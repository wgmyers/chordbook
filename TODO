Chordbook
=========

An application to manage books of chords for bands.

TODO next:
----------

* Create output files directly so we don't have to use '>' to create output
* Option to create multipage HTML files (why?)
* Externalise HTML template
* Externalise CSS for HTML
* Repeat sections

Implemented:
------------

* Basic commandline functionality
* Reads and parses a JSON input file containing a book of songs with chords
* Plaintext output mode
* HTML output mode, which prints more or less nicely
* Transposition feature

Initial plan:
-------------

Phase 1
-------

Command-line engine.

Take input in form of textfile.

Just chords and sections for now.

Use JSON to format input file

Produce output suitable for printing in song-per-page format for stage use.

Modularise output. So it can be plaintext, html, LaTex etc, with output
type specified by a commandline option and actual output handled by
pluggable code modules.

First two modules to write:

Text
HTML

Phase 2
-------

* Lyrics
* Tablature scraps
* Topline melody (in certain output types, eg MuseScore)

Phase 3
-------

* GUI front-end interface for input
* GUI front-end interface for output
